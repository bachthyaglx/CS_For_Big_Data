Explain the concept of a generator in Python.
- Unlike return and exit
- Generator generates a sequence of values incrementally and can be paused and resumed
- When call a generator, a generator object is created to iterate through the values it produces.

Why can't fib(60) or fib(90) be computed recursively?
- Huge amount of memory and time consumption due to recursive

What is the more limiting constraint: memory use or needed run time?
- Memory use
