How many time is the "first element" stored?
- 11 times

How much memory is used for applying the function to a list of n numbers?
- Each recursive call creates its own stack frame
- Stack frame can not exceed the maximum recursion depth allowed in Python

import sys
print(sys.getrecursionlimit())

- The default recursion limit in Python is typically set to 1000
- A recursive function can make up to 1000 nested calls before reaching the recursion limit

What is the run-time estimate for sum() given a list of n numbers?

- The function will make n recursive calls, performing a constant amount of work in each call.
- O(n), a linear time complexity where the number of operations grows linearly with the size of the input (n)

How many stack-frames are used for a list of n numbers?
- The number of elements in the list (11 stack-frames)
